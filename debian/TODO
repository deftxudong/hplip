hpiod:
    1. Fix pidfile locking so that main thread waits for the others to die
       before exiting
    2. Privilege separation, do away with most crap as root
    3. Fix hpiod syslog to also include [pid] information

hpssd.py:
    1. remove all hardcoded paths
    2. syslog() stuff instead of dumping to stdout, and do it in a less
       hideous way than "khazad-dum python:  [ERROR] ..."

    U1. Get upstream to allow one to configure sender address, etc
    U2. Date header (#291277), precedence header too.

sane backend:
    1. provide sane-<whatever> manpage

build:
   1. use python automake support
   1a. Make sure to call python as the detected python in autoconf, NOT as "python"
       when that's fixed, remove "python" build-dep.
   2. get all the hplip stuff into a hplip *python* package (basically, add hplip. before every import)
      2a. then move it out of /usr/lib into the python paths
   3. remove hardcoding of /etc/hp, make it a configure.in thing
   4. remove python #! lines from stuff that are not end-user executables (done?)
   5. fix and submit upstream something less hackish than the data -> ../share/data symlink
