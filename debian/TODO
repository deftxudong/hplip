General:
    1. keep one eye on fab for hp-fab symlink and to add python license to copyright
       file when the fax support is ready.

  hpiod:
    1. Fix pidfile locking so that main thread waits for the others to die
       before exiting

  hpssd.py:
    1. remove all hardcoded paths
    3. syslog() stuff instead of dumping to stdout

    U1. Get upstream to allow one to configure sender address, etc
    U2. Date header (#291277), precedence header too.

  sane stuff:
    1. provide sane-<whatever> manpage

  build:
   1. use python automake support
   1a. Make sure to call python as the detected python in autoconf, NOT as "python"
       when that's fixed, remove "python" build-dep.
   2. get all the hplip stuff into a hplip *python* package (basically, add hplip. before every import)
      2a. then move it out of /usr/lib into the python paths
   3. remove hardcoding of /etc/hp, make it a configure.in thing
   4. remove python #! lines from stuff that are not end-user executables (done?)
   5. fix and submit upstream something less hackish than the data -> ../share/data symlink

  CUPSYS:
   1. cupsys restart seems to be required to get new printers (!!!!)

  FOOMATIC:
   1. all PPDs should be in /etc somewhere.  The best way to do this is
      probably another link to /etc/ppds added to /etc/share/cups/models
      or something.
