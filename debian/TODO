  daemons:
    1. kill all hpguid.py instances on stop (initscript) in a better way,
       ideally we should get hpssd to do it by itself

  hpguid.py:
    2. Make sure it does pidfile locking properly

  hpiod:
    1. Fix pidfile locking so that main thread waits for the others to die
       before exiting

  hpssd.py:
    1. remove all hardcoded paths
    2. run as not-root?
    3. syslog() stuff instead of dumping to stdout
    4. install hpssd link in usr/sbin, and use that in the initscript

    U1. Get upstream to allow one to confure sender address, etc
    U2. Date header (#291277), precedence header too.

  sane stuff:
    1. provide sane-<whatever> manpage

  misc:
    1. locate what is an user binary and what isn't, and add
       hplip_* links to them in /usr/bin
    2. Add debian menu entries, KDE and GNOME desktop entries
    3. docbase-register the html readme in hplip and hpijs pkgs

  build:
   1. use python automake support
   1a. Make sure to call python as the detected python in autoconf, NOT as "python"
       when that's fixed, remove "python" build-dep.
   2. get all the hplip stuff into a hplip *python* package (basically, add hplip. before every import)
      2a. then move it out of /usr/lib into the python paths
      2b. bytecompile the mess
   3. rename all toplevel utilities to hplip_*
   4. remove hardcoding of /etc/hp, make it a configure.in thing
   5. remove python #! lines from stuff that are not end-user executables
   6. fix and submit upstream something less hackish than the data -> ../share/data symlink

  CUPSYS:
   1. hp backend requires all hp drivers to be running
   2. cupsys restart seems to be required to get new printers (!!!!)

  FOOMATIC:
   1. all PPDs should be in /etc somewhere.  The best way to do this is probably another
      link to /etc/ppds added to /etc/share/cups/models or something.

  upstream:
    - Check the HP copyright stuff added to derived works (async/async_qt.py)

  Annoyances:
   1. Turns on printer (HP DJ 5550) on CUPS restart, if the printer is
      already on the CUPS printer list
