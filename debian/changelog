    + CUPS 1.2 compatibility
    * HPLIP 1.6.6 (patchlevel 1):

        timeout instead of aborting
      + Fixed the File Types that can be directly added to the fax job could

      + Added 30sec retry and timeout to hpfax
      + Added CUPS 1.2 compatible output to hpfax
      + Removed DeviceOpen from hp backend. This fixes two problems 1) usblp
        will no longer be removed for device discovery 2) device discovery
        will no longer cause Inkjets to power-up (closes: #369286)
      + Changed hp backend device discovery verbage in order to work better
        with CUPS 1.2
      + Fixed status-types for 2006-09 devices (5 --> 2)
      + Fixed panel display for older OfficeJets that have VSTATUS
      + Fixed "no printers installed, run toolbox, install printer, toolbox
        produces error" bug
      + Updated hpfax to "No devices found" text and behavior
      + Removed extraneous syslog message during parallel port ProbeDevice
      + Rewrite of toolbox refresh code. Should fix long running issue
      + Fixed HP-Toolbox no activity after an hour causes toolbox to

        status-type broken out into status-type, status-battery-check, and
        status-dynamic-counters
      + Made hplip_GetID more bullet proof in hplip_api.c
      + Fixed invalid memory free in libsane-hpaio. Only occurred in the
        sane_hpaio_open abort path
      + Changed 1284.4/MLC credit reply timeout from 2 to 4 seconds in

      + Removed support dialog (should have been removed in 0.9.11, was
        missed)
      + Changed Tools and Support pane to include "View Documentation"
        rather than "View Support" - opens online docs in browser like

      + Added sane hpaio.desc file to documentation
    * HPIJS 2.6.6:
      + Fixed an auto duplex problem in HPIJS

        + Photosmart C3100 series (DJGenericVIP)
        + Photosmart D7300 series (DJGenericVIP)
      + Updated the Ghostscript KRGB patch: Revisited the KRGB buffer
        overflow issue with out-of-band data in fill_rectangle and
        copy_mono.  Changed the fill_rectangle and copy_mono to an inner
        loop buffer check instead of a outer loop x/y extent check.
        As requested by Ralph Giles, added K 1-bit (KRGB) and 8-bit (KxRGB)
        support for KRGB, but only 1-bit is implemented for now
  * hpijs-ppds: depend on foomatic-filters as the PPDs require foomatic-rip
    to work.  Version dependency to a new enough foomatic-rip (available in
    stable as well, so this is not strictly needed, but still...)
    (closes: #369833)
  * hpijs: drop suggestion on foomatic-filters, hpijs doesn't use it for
    anything anyway, and the PPDs (who do) now depend on it
  * hplip: recommend one of hpijs-ppds or linuxprinting.org-ppds instead of
    suggesting both.  HPLIP really needs a PPD to do anything useful
  * Improve description of the hplip-dbg package a little
  * debian/watch: remove outdated URIs, update to version 3
  * dpatch 00_01_upstream-0.9.11-2 (remove): applied upstream
  * dpatch 00_01_upstream-1.6.6-1 (new): upstream HPLIP 1.6.6-1
  * dpatch 40_quiet-hpiod (remove): accepted upstream
  * dpatch 60_lp_instead_of_lpr: rediff
  * dpatches 50_ui-supportform-cleanups, 55_ui-supportform-debian (disable):
    upstream removed the supportform, but we may want to add those panes
    somewhere else so just disable the patches for now
  * dpatch 20_fix_warnings (new): fix broken code in hpijs that caused
    warnings
  * Remove old KRGB 1.2 patches

        has the same error code multiple times in a row
      + Changes auto device refresh interval units from seconds to minutes
        in the hp-toolbox
      + Added a device auto refresh type (all or 1) to settings dialog in

    * HPIJS 2.1.10:
      + Moved PSC 21xx from DJGenericVIP to DJ9xxVIP device class
        (this requires all PSC 21xx users to update their PPDs)
      + Forced hpijs and hppgsz to always build with -DNDEBUG
      + Merged hpijs_readme.html into hplip documentation
      + Added support for the following new printers:

    to point users to the hplip-doc package and to the online manual

      + Fixed jetdirect write timeout in hpiod
      + Added deviceID to output of "hp" backend for CUPS 1.2
      + Fixed a problem where no fax send dialog pops up when sending
        a fax job from OpenOffice Writer and the fax job can not be sent
        correctly
      + Fixed a hp-setup crash which can occur during fax setup testpage
        printing
      + Modified the hp-toolbox and hp-print so that they will work with
        unsupported printer models without crashing
      + Hp-setup now allows the user to manually enter a PPD file path
      + The "NickName" from each located PPD file is displayed to the user
        so that the "(recommended)" text will be shown.
      + Fixed an error which occurs while executing hp-sendfax with
        b parameter.

  * configure.in, Makefile.am, debian/rules, prnt/hpijs/configure.in:

hplip (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * HPIJS 2.1.9:
      + Fixed an array index underflow in ljfastraster.cpp

        + HP DeskJet F300 Series All-in-one (DJ3600)
    * HPLIP 0.9.9:
      + HPLIP now uses libusb for all USB I/O.  Libusb replaces kernel
        modules printer and usblp, and opens an entirely new can of worms
      + Removed support for USB URIs based on device files.  This means all
        printers now use USB URIs based on "hp:/hp_model?serial=xxxxxxxx"
        instead of "hp:/hp_model?device=/dev/usb/lpx".  Old CUPS queues must
        be updated to the new device location
      + Added full USB 1284.4 support for the Color LaserJet 2840, and for
        LaserJets 3050, 3060, 1010, 1012, 1015 and 2500

      + Add models.xml parallel port flag for Deskjet 5550
      + Moved hp-sendfax temp .g3 files to ~/hpfax/hpfax-*.g3.  Before,
        they would clutter the user's home directory
      + Files added to hp-sendfax interface are now rendered into g3 format
        as they are added to the batch
      + Removed temporary file creation from hpfax: (temp files now created
        only by hp-sendfax using mkstemp)
      + Added total page counting feature to hp-sendfax
      + Added a BSD license to magic.py
  * debian/control: build-depend on libusb >= 0.1.8

  * hplip.menu: s/hp-fax/hp-sendfax/

  * debian/control, debian/rules: provide and use hpijs:Upstream-Version,
    rename Upstream-Version to hplip:Upstream-Version
  * Rename hplip-ppds package to hpijs-ppds, update all documentation to
    point to hpijs-ppds and linuxprinting.org-ppds and add a hpijs.NEWS
    entry about the package rename as well
  * debian/control: conflict hpijs with hplip-ppds versioned to source
    version, as a dirty trick to not clash with hpijs-ppds providing
    hplip-ppds
  * debian/rules, debian/hpijs-ppds.install, debian/hpijs-ppds.links,
    debian/hpijs-ppds.NEWS:
    Don't ship non-hpijs PPDs anymore, linuxprinting.org-ppds takes care
    of the pure postscript PPDs now
  * debian/rules: version hpijs-ppds the same way we version hpijs
  * debian/control: suggest hpijs-ppds and linuxprinting.org-ppds for hplip
    instead of recommending the old hplip-ppds package.  Recommend hpijs
    with fax support for hplip. Remove conflict on foomatic-db-hpijs and
    foomatic-filters-ppds from hplip.  Conflict hpijs-ppds with
    foomatic-filters-ppds before 20060113-1 when the PPD duplication was
    removed from foomatic-filters-ppds
  * debian/control: rework package descriptions a little
  * debian/rules: ship all PPD files compressed
  * debian/rules: separate arch-dep and arch-indep install, to avoid wasting
    a great deal of time on slower archs gziping PPDs
  * hplip initscript: Run hpiod as root because of libusb
  * debian/copyright: update dates

        rather than device URIs (hp-sendfax, hp-print)
      + Fixed a hpiod problem with the PS 2570 series. This will fix the
        scanning blue-screen error with USB High Speed

  * Let configure detect all standard paths for CUPS, except for the
    PPD path
  * Prune non-shipped-files.txt, and change debian/rules to tell us
    which files were removed instead of doing it silently
  * dpatch 70_sane_ppd_directory_handling (new): modify hplip to
    look for PPD files under /usr/share/ppd/hplip, instead of
    searching the entire CUPS PPD tree (used by hp-setup)
  * Add menu entries for hp-print, hp-sendfax and hp-fab
  * Add HPmenu.xpm icon
  * dpatch 35_no-fax-setuid (new): change hpssd fax queue function
    not to setuid(), as we don't run as root.  This limits sending
    faxes somehow, but the impact is not clear to me yet.  Bug reports
    welcome
  * dpatch 45_quiet_hpijs-fax (new): remove noisy hpijs debug output in
    the fax driver
  * debian/control: rework package descriptions, mention fax support
  * Ship KRGB patches cleaned up and tailored for Debian's gs versions
  * Update debian/copyright for new directories, mention license of KRGB

hplip (0.9.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream 0.9.7-2 patch: fixes for the following problems:
    + Photosmart 2570 series blue screen scanning error
    + GetDeviceStatus overwrite in hpiod (from RedHat)
    + SuperB margin issue with OJ K550, OJ K850 and DJ9800
    + _GNU_SOURCE define in hpaio.h. (from RedHat)
  * Remove versioning of python-qt3 and pyqt-utils build-dependencies to
    make backports easier.  Current versions in stable, testing and sid
    are safe AFAIK
  * Build-depend on libsnmp9-dev|libsnmp5-dev, to ease sarge backports

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Dec 2005 14:05:12 -0200

hplip (0.9.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch from two versioned conflicts to two versioned depends/recommends
    to encode the relationship between hplip and hplip-data.  This is
    easier on apt, since conflicts preclude unpack, while depends preclude
    configure
  * Fix non-removal of rem_str on 60_lp_instead_of_lpr (closes: #341445)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Nov 2005 15:04:33 -0200

hplip (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

hplip (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * HPIJS 2.1.7:
      + Fixed OJ K550 typo in HPIJS
      + Added photo tray support to DJGenericVIP device class. This effects
        all DJGenericVIP PPD files
      + Added support for the following new printers:
        + HP Color LaserJet 3000 (LJColor/PS)
        + HP Color LaserJet 3600 (LJJetReady)
        + HP Color LaserJet 3800 (LJColor/PS)
    * HPLIP 0.9.7:
      + Added 1284.4 support to hpiod. Previous support was MLC only
      + Changed hp-toolbox startup behavior to increase performance
      + Added checks in messaging code to prevent invalid messages from
        crashing hpssd
      + Added hp-toolbox PML cleanup code to LJ status code
      + Fixed clj28xx scanning issue. Mfpdtf buffer was too small
        libsane-hpaio. This fixes a problem introduced in 0.9.5
      + Modified hp-makeuri to allow hostnames for network addresses
      + Added support for "alternate n-up" for PS documents to hp-print
      + Fixed an issue where the website link for support information is
        wrong in "HP" tab of "Support Information" dialog
      + Fixed an issue setting the scan token in libsane-hpaio
      + Fixed an issue where an error occurs while executing the command
        "hp-check -lnone" in terminal
      + Fixed an issue where an exception is caught but the program does not
        show a correct prompt when running the command "hp-align" with parameter
        -p
      + Fixed System::GetSnmp sigfault in hpiod. This will fix network
        scanning/hp-toolbox issues in previous HPLIP releases
      + Fixed an issue where an error occurs while executing hp-photo after
        the usb cable was disconnected
  * Use far less tight versioning that works with the new rules for binNMUs,
    and break a dependency loop while at it (closes: #339909)
  * Add versioned dependency on coreutils 5.1+ (closes: #337375)
  * New dpatch 60_lp_instead_of_lpr:
    Use "lp" instead of "lpr" to submit jobs (closes: #336407)
  * Ship copyright and changelogs along with hplip-data too, as it is not
    depending on hplip anymore and the /usr/share/doc/hplip-data symlink has
    to go away

hplip (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * HPIJS 2.1.6:
      + Moved DJ450 from DJGenericVIP class to DJ9xxVIP class, because
        mandatory margins are 0.25 inch on left and right sides and it does
        not support fullbleed on any papersize
      + Added a new printer family, DJ55xx to take care of margin issues for
        DJ55xx printers
      + Fixed a bug in sending custom paper size to JetReady and FastRaster
        printers
      + Fixed a bug in LJFastRaster when last band was less than 128 height,
        it was incorrectly positioned.
      + Fixed margin adjustment code to allow fullbleed or .125 inch margins
        for those printers that support it in autoduplex mode
      + Added support for the following new printers:
        + HP Color LaserJet 4730 MFP (LJColor/PS)
        + HP Deskjet 460 (DJGenericVIP)
        + HP Officejet Pro K550, K850 (DJGenericVIP)
    * HPLIP 0.9.6:
      + In hp-toolbox (Device Manager) made a small LaserJet status change
        that makes the CLJ 2550 work correctly
      + Fixed a bug with the PSC3310 with low photo supplies (caused a
        toolbox exception)
      + Fixed a problem that made an offline CLJ2500 crash hpssd
      + The hp-toolbox no longer uses a "listen" server socket.  All
        communication is done over the same client socket to hpssd
      + Added new hp-toolbox UI for supplies and maintenance tools
      + Made numerous changes to hp-toolbox
      + Set CLJ 25xx devices to uni-di mode in models.xml
  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Remove patches already applied upstream:
      00_upstream-0.9.5-3, 11_fix-misc-gcc-warnings, 13_intsign-fixes,
      15_64bit_fixes, 20_fix_unitialized_var_bugs, 50_hp-clean_fix,
      99_ubuntu_hplip-deroot
    * Remove some hunks already applied upstream:
      14_charsign_fixes
    * Add a NEWS file for hpijs, warning users of PPDs that are documented
      by upstream to have been changed significantly
    * Fix hpijs autobuild system to actually work re. libhpip, by adding
      some automake magic and libtool support
    * Merge hplip-base and hplip packages.  Current upstream code makes it
      a losing battle to try to keep the two separate
    * Don't bother explaining about alternate PPD sources in basic docs like
      README.Debian.  Don't suggest them in control file, either.  This is
      needed because HPLIP PPDs often change in non-forward or non-backwards
      compatible ways
    * Remove stray scan/__init__.py file
    * New patch 30_noping: Do not attempt to send icmp packets in hpssd, as
      it will not work since it doesn't run as root anymore.  Thanks to
      tatu.mannisto@iki.fi for the report (closes: #333850)
    * New patch 40_quiet-hpiod: Shut hpiod up while trying to autodetect
      parallel port printers, it was being waay too annoying in syslog
    * New patch 50_doc-location: Add final / to URIs and point the readme
      to the /usr/share/doc location inside hp-toolbox.  If the local admin
      doesn't like documentation and removes /usr/share/doc/hplip, this
      doesn't break anything... you just get no documentation, which was
      kind the point the admin was trying to make, I suppose ;-)

hplip (0.9.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Add more hunks to 14_charsign_fixes, probably non-critical fixes
    * Clean up and revamp configure.in/Makefile.am so that it is less buggy
      re. some 'assumptions' made upstream (closes: #329782)
    * Version pyqt build-dependendices to make sure no autobuilder will
      screw us over the C++/gcc transition, these can be removed in the
      not-so-distant future
    * Fix minor typo in a package description
    * Move hp-print from hplip-base to hplip, as it has a GUI now, thanks
      to HPLIP upstream for the bug report
    * Move /usr/lib/hplip/plugins from hplip-base to hplip package, as it
      is an ui/ component

    * Add hplip-base.post{inst,rm} and initscript machinery for the hplip
      user, supporting ephemeral /var/run and dpkg-statoverride the way I
      like it

      nothing in hpiod or hpssd that requires root priviledges to work in a
      Debian system
    * Add NEWS.Debian item about running as non-root

      + Changed and added new "io" support tags to models.xml

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Minor updates to README.Debian on the various packages
    * Rework package descriptions a bit in control file
    * Stop confliting with HPOJ.  We are fine with it as long as the same
      device is NOT being used by HPOJ and HPIJS
    * Remove hplip-base dependency from hplip-ppds. Instead, suggest
      hpijs and hplip-base in hplip-ppds, and ship changelog instead of symlink
    * Remove some stray -Nhplip crap from arch-dep section of rules files
    * Remove 12_fix-gcc4-errors.dpatch, accepted upstream (patch 0.9.3-1)
    * debian/rules: avoid useless /usr/bin/find warnings about

hplip (0.9.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * New binary-all package: hplip-ppds, with the PPDs shipped by HPLIP
      upstream.  Other than due to bug-fixes, these are usually a better
      match for the current hpijs/hplip capabilities than those from
      foomatic-filters-ppds or foomatic-db-hpijs
    * Change the Manufacturer string on all PPDs to "HP (HPLIP)", to set
      them apart from PPDs of other sources
    * Update README.Debian with information about the HPLIP PPDs
    * Recommend hplip-ppds (closes: #311470, #311474)

hplip (0.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

        left margin issue
      + Fixed a problem printing more than one page with LJ 1010/1012
      + Modified hpijs to ignore bi-di errors so the "hp" backend can
        handle them.  This fixed a problem where hpijs would hang
        forever
    * HPLIP 0.9.3:
      + Modified models.xml Deskjet_1220C panel_check_type to be 0

      + Fixed "hp-probe -s*" error
      + Fixed error while clicking the"Access Photo Cards" without any
        photo card

      + In models.xml cloned HP LaserJet 4050 Series to the same thing with a
        trailing underscore
  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Swap maintainer and uploader fields for now, since I am spending
      far more time in HPLIP than Torsten.  Should that change, he will
      switch the fields back as they were
    * Tell libtool that the sane plugin is a plugin with -module
    * Split hplip into GUI and non-GUI packages, as suggested by
      Matthias Klose <doko@ubuntu.com> (closes: #307790)
      + Change /usr/share/doc/hplip to a symlink (requires hplip.preinst
        and hplip.postinst glue to support error unwind and downgrades)
      + Change hplip package to arch all, as all C source and binary
        modules belong in hplip-base
      + hplip-base.preinst (new), hplip-base.postrm (new), hplip.postrm:
        Remove any .pyc and .pyo files scattered around /usr/lib/hplip
    * Fix configure.in, Makefile.am to accept and use a PYTHON variable
      to select the python version to run properly, and really use whatever
      python that variable points to, and no other (closes: #307788)
    * Rework configure.in and Makefile.am a bit, in a moment of utter
      boredom
    * Change autogen.sh and debian/rules to get the hpijs versioning
      through autoconf --trace at autotools-run time, and document the
      debian/hpijs.version file in debian/README.Source
    * Remove unneeded #! lines from python modules before packaging the
      debs, to make lintian happier
    * Control new files showing up upstream, by using a static list of
      non-shipped files and passing --fail-missing to dh_install
    * Remove debian/executable.files and debian/deletable.files support,
      as this package does not require it
    * hplip-base: recommend cupsys-client, as some of the utilities
      run "lp -d..." and friends (closes: #308960)
    * Rediff 01_rss.dpatch, 10_missing-prototypes.dpatch,
      11_fix-misc-gcc-warnings.dpatch, 13_intsign-fixes.dpatch,
      40_testmail_fix.dpatch, 50_hp-clean_fix.dpatch to remove some hunks

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * HPLIP:
      * SECURITY FIX: create .hplip.conf on user directory mode 600 (was 666)
        The HPLIP suite was failing to set the process umask to sane values,
        hpssd.py and hpguid.py were affected.  Also, modify HPLIP so that it
        warns the user of the broken permissions, ignores such a file, and 
        fixes the permissions on the next time the config file is written to.
        Thanks to Erwan David <erwan@rail.eu.org> for reporting this bug

  * New upstream source
    + Fixed a issue with the max setting for input trays in APDK (HPIJS 2.0.1)

      printers when doing dynamic counters
    + Fixed a defect in strings.py (wrong string for not installed cart)

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:

      is much easier
    * HPLIP:
      * Try to stop all instances of hpguid.py on initscript stop.  We need
        to revisit this later when hpguid and hpssd get more intelligent
        hpguid pidfile/termination handling

      * This is not complete yet.  This package has not been validated to
        work on 64-bit archs (help is welcome) upstream.  We have absolutely
        no idea if the MFP utilities (photo-card reading, SANE scanning) work
        at all (help is also welcome).
      * Do not install this if you are not ready to help track down the bugs

    * Update autogen.sh for automake 1.9, rerun autotools

      upstream lacks one
    * Modify configure.in so that our CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS are respected
    * Add a simple manpage for the hpijs binary with pointers to the real
