hplip (0.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * New dpatch (30_bind_to_INADDR_LOOPBACK):
      Bind to INADDR_LOOPBACK instead of to INADDR_ANY for now, as
      HPLIP is constrained to working bound to localhost currently
      (closes: #304068)

hplip (0.8.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * UNRELEASED: This release was never uploaded to unstable due to serious
    issues with many devices

  * New upstream version:
    * Added low ink infrastructure to device manager

hplip (0.8.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * HPLIP:
      * SECURITY FIX: create .hplip.conf on user directory mode 600 (was 666)
        The HPLIP suite was failing to set the process umask to sane values,
        hpssd.py and hpguid.py were affected.  Also, modify HPLIP so that it
        warns the user of the broken permissions, ignores such a file, and 
        fixes the permissions on the next time the config file is written to.
        Thanks to Erwan David <erwan@rail.eu.org> for reporting this bug
        (closes: #293117)
    * Really fix debian/rules to unpatch only after cleaning the tree

hplip (0.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
    + Fixed a issue with the max setting for input trays in APDK (HPIJS 2.0.1)
    + Added OfficeJet K series support
    + Changed scanning default compression from none to jpeg. This speeds up
      device I/O significantly during scans
    + Cleaned up cancel button functionality in device manager.
    + Added r value caching to hpssd to increase responsiveness of some
      printers when doing dynamic counters
    + Fixed a defect in strings.py (wrong string for not installed cart)
    + Added DeviceIDs to the models.xml file
    + Added PPD files for the following new printers: LaserJet 4345 MFP,
      LaserJet 3015/3020/3030
    + Fixed some devices which were wrongly set to MLC mode instead of RAW
  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Better dpatch support on debian/rules: use clean-patched target
      instead of reinvoking make
    * Patches 22_hpssd_pidfile and 50_bigendian merged upstream
    * Rediff all dpatches and switch to -p1, so that using dpatch-edit-patch
      is much easier
    * HPLIP:
      * Try to stop all instances of hpguid.py on initscript stop.  We need
        to revisit this later when hpguid and hpssd get more intelligent
        hpguid pidfile/termination handling

        problems with gcc 4.0 on AMD64 (#286353)
      * Improve suggests: for foomatic and hplip integration
    * HPLIP:
      * Conflict with all non-bidir-enabled hpijs and foomatic versions
      * Add a quick-install guide to README.Debian
      * Be silent about CUPS reloads, to avoid startling users during
        system shutdown
  * Upload to Debian unstable.  Do note that 64-bit archs are still an
    unknown (feedback welcome)

hplip (0.8.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Source for HPIJS is now provided by the HPLIP source package
  * Version of the hpijs package will now be:
    <hpijs upstream version>+<hplip package version>

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * HPIJS:
      * New upstream source, supports HPLIP bi-directional channels, and
        DJGenericVIP four-sided full bleed printing.  Now support printers
        that require bi-directional channels to work.
      * Update Depends: to versions of the gs packages with KRBG support
      * Ship KRGB patch in usr/share/doc
    * HPLIP:
      * Added pidfile locking to hpiod, hpssd [merged upstream in 0.8.4]
      * Fixed upstream autotools build system something fierce
      * Build libhpip as a convenience library (and don't package it)
      * Add hplip_* links to the user binaries on /usr/bin
      * Add a hpssd link on /usr/sbin and use that on initscript
      * Support xpp as a default "print" GUI interface

      * This is not complete yet.  This package has not been validated to
        work on 64-bit archs (help is welcome) upstream.  We have absolutely
        no idea if the MFP utilities (photo-card reading, SANE scanning) work
        at all (help is also welcome).
      * Do not install this if you are not ready to help track down the bugs

    * Urgency high, since this is only an upstream-sync upload with

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:

      PPD files from this source package).
    * Update autogen.sh for automake 1.9, rerun autotools
    * Remove all autogenerated files from CVS tree (use debian/autogen.sh to
      recreate the files, debian/rules should do this automatically on
      cvs-buildpackage)
    * Suggests foomatic-db-hpijs (closes: #270566)

  * Add comment about rss patch to package description (closes: #209127)
  * Fix hpijs segfaults (probably non-exploitable) when given bad parameters,
    or when something bad happens at startup time.  HPIJS really needs an
    audit, since the code is doing NULL pointer derreferences that easily
    (closes: #169587)

        Japanese #4
      + Added KRGB colorspace support (patch to ghostscript required to

    * Update standards version to 3.6.1
    * Add copyright notice for the Debian packaging to debian/copyright

    * Set things up so that we regen the entire autotools toolchain (by
      calling autogen.sh) on cvs-checkout.  Add an autogen.sh, since
      upstream lacks one
    * Modify configure.in so that our CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS are respected
    * Add a simple manpage for the hpijs binary with pointers to the real
      docs, since hpijs is NEVER called directly
