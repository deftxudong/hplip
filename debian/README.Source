Due to autotools (actually, to avoid running them needlessly),
almost all patches to the build infrastructure are NOT in dpatch 
format, but rather applied directly.

This will change if upstream ever takes the hint and stop
abusing autotools.  This package should have exactly two configure
scripts, not the huge (and *slooooow*) amount of them it currently
has.
