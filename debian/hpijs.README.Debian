Notes about the Debian hpijs package
------------------------------------

This package includes the rss patch from

	http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/printing/hpijs/
	
This patch tries to make sure that black is printed with just
the black pen, if the printer supports it.  Almost all new
HP printers (those using the DJGenericVIP model) do colormap 
conversion in firmware, and will completely ignore the rss 
patch.

It is a very good idea to install the hpoj package if you have
a parallel-port HP printer, or the hplip package if you have
an USB or JetDirect HP printer.
