Description: HP Linux Printing and Imaging System (hplip)
 This is the HP Linux Printing and Imaging System.  It provides full
 support for printing on most HP SFP (single function peripheral)
 InkJets and many LaserJets, and for scanning and photo-card access on
 most HP MFP (multi-funtcion peripheral) printers.
 .
 HPLIP is composed of:
  * HP CUPS backend driver (hp:/) with bi-directional communication with
    HP printers (provides printer status feedback to CUPS and enhanced
    HPIJS functionality such as 4-side fullbleed printing support)
  * HPIJS Ghostscript IJS driver to rasterize output from PostScript(tm)
    files or from any other input format supported by Ghostscript
  * Command line utilities to perform printer maintenance, such as 
    ink-level monitoring or pen cleaning and calibration
  * Command line utility to download data from the photo card interfaces
    in MFP devices
  * A GUI toolbox to access all these functions in a friendly way
  * HPAIO SANE backend (hpaio) for flatbed and Automatic Document Feeder 
    (ADF) scanning in MFP devices
 .
 HPLIP can page an administrator (through email or a popup window through 
 a X11 session) when the printer needs attention.
 .
 Only USB and JetDirect (network) devices are supported.  For parallel-port
 devices, please use the hpoj package instead.
 .
 You will need the hpijs package to have a working Unix printing solution.

Description: HP Linux Printing and Imaging - data files
 This package contains data files for the HP Linux Printing and
 Imaging System.

Package: hpijs

Description: HP Linux Printing and Imaging - gs IJS driver (hpijs)
 This package contains the hpijs binary which provides Ghostscript
 with a IJS driver for most inkjet printers and some LaserJet printers
 manufactured by HP.
 .
 It includes the so-called rss patch, to use pure black ink instead
 of composite black in printers that don't do color map conversion
 in firmware.
 .
 Users of USB and JetDirect HP printers are advised to also install the
 hplip package, and use the hp: CUPS backend to send data to the printer.
 Selecting any hpijs ppd in CUPS will use hpijs automatically.
 .
 Users of parallel-port HP printers are advised to install the hpoj
 package, and use it to send the hpijs output to the printer.
 .
 HPIJS is meant to be used through the foomatic system (see the
 foomatic-filters package).
